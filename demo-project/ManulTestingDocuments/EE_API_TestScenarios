After doing some exploratory testing, It is observed that GET, POST and DELETE calls are implemented in the system. PUT call is not implemented.
Browser network calls and Postman tools  used to carry out exploratory testing

Here are the test scenarios for REST API testing

1. Verify the GET request to following URI is returing json content with all bookings present in the system with the status code '200 ok'	
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking
		
2. Verify the GET request to following URI with a booking id in it is returning details of the given booking idwith the status code '200 ok'	
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking/<bookingid>
		
3. Verify that GET request with a non existing booking id is returning a '404 Not Found' error message
	
4. Verify that when json booking data is sent in a POST request to the following URL , booking is getting created with the status code '201 created'
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking/
		{
			"firstname": "fname1",
			"lastname": "sname1",
			"totalprice": "23",
			"depositpaid": "false",
			"bookingdates": {
				"checkin": "2019-11-01",
				"checkout": "2019-11-02"
			}
		}
5. Verify that when POST request is sent with missing mandatory json data, No booking should get created and '400' error code should be shown
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking/
		
6. Verify that when POST request is sent with malformed json data, No booking should get created and '400' error code should be shown
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking/
		
7. Verify that DELETE request is deleting a given booking id with '200 ok' status code
		http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/booking/1335
		
8. When invalid Header is passed in POST request, booking should get failed with valid status code

9. Test for response times
